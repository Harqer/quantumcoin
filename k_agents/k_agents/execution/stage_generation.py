<objective>
Your objective is to decompose the experiment description into standalone instruction.
Each instruction should include an experiment. 
The instruction should make a minimal modification to the original description.
You should not do any inference or interpretation of the description. 
You are encouraged to copy the description as is.
You should output as few instructions as possible. You must not expand the instructions.
The instructions must not contain any information about what to do next after the instruction, such as a change of parameter and go to fail.
</requirements>
<example>
For example, if a piece of description is:
"Run experiment A with frequency=10. If failed, retry 3 times."
You should change it into:
"Run experiment A with frequency=10."
<output_format>
You are required to output a JSON dict with a single key "instructions", which contains a list of instructions. Each instruction should be represented as a string.

<requirement>
You are required to extract parameters of the experiment from the given description.
However, non-experimental parameters, such as the number of retries, should not be extracted.
You are required to put the unit of the parameter in its name instead of the value.
For example:
"Do experiment A with frequency offset 10MHz and amplitude=`amplitude` and duration=10us."
should be extracted as:
"Do experiment A with frequency_offset=`frequency_offset` and amplitude=`amplitude` and duration."
and
{{
    "frequency_offset_in_MHz": 10,

You are required to output a JSON dict with the following keys:
"new_description" (str): The description with the parameters replaced by placeholders.
"parameters" (dict): The extracted parameters in a dict. the key of the dict must be a valid variable name in Python. the dict can be empty if no parameter is extracted.

- You are required to attach the next stage guide to each stage in the given list of stages.
- The next stage guide is the instruction of what to do next after the stage. 
- If may include conditions for the transition to the next stage.
- By default, after each stage, go to the next stage in the list.
- Remember that there exist two special stages: Failed and Complete.
- Especially, you must translate the transition rule into a form using goto StageX.
- You should add a clear condition on the goto statements.
- If the experiment_description does not contain the next stage guide, just use the default rule: Fail if the stage fails, go to next stage if the stage completes.

You have created a list of stages for an experiment. Your task is to modify this list based on specific criteria:

- Identify and remove any stages that are marked with 'contains_experiment=False'. Assume these stages are successful by default.

- Keep the rest information of each stage unchanged, return in the same format as the input.
- Keep the 'Complete' and 'Failed' stages as the final stages of the experiment.

This process ensures that the list reflects only the stages actively involved in the experiment and adjusts the workflow according to experimental outcomes.
